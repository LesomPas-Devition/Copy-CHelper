# CHelper

**This project is unfinished, so it can't work.**

## Description

I want to make an Android command IDE for minecraft bedrock version , so here is CHelper, which means Command
Helper.

## Plan

- [x] make a lexer, which let the command string become token list.
- [x] make cpack, which is a resources pack contained ID and command.
- [ ] parser, which let token list become element list. Element can contain many elements.
- [ ] checker, which will check the element through other element.
- [ ] ...

## Why choose c++

Because I am leaning c++ now, I want to improve myself through the project.
